# EcoQuest🌱: A Path to a Greener Future 🌎
 

## 💭 Inspiration

There is not much climate change awareness among younger kids and we believe that needs to change.  

We set out to create something **fun**, **user-friendly**, and **engaging** that would help kids understand the importance of protecting the environment from an early age.  

We believe that **today’s children will grow up to save the world**.  
Through EcoQuest🌱, we aim to spark curiosity, plant seeds of responsibility, and inspire future climate heroes — all through the power of play.

## 🌸 What It Does
EcoQuest🌱 is an interactive board game where kids embark on an exciting climate adventure.
As they roll the dice and move across the board, they face fun challenges, answer eco-questions, and learn real-world sustainability tips.
Through play, children build environmental awareness and develop the knowledge and habits that will help them protect our planet.

## 🧩 Challenges We Faced

- ### ⏰ Time Crunch:  
  We built EcoQuest🌱 in an incredibly short window of just two days — learning JavaScript while building the project at the same time.

- ### 🛠️ Learning New Tech:  
  Mastering JavaScript fundamentals like functions, loops, conditionals, and DOM manipulation under a tight deadline wasn’t easy — but we did it!

- ###  👥 Team Coordination:  
  Working together remotely and merging different parts of the code required clear communication and trust.

- ### 🔄 Debugging:  
  We ran into a lot of tiny bugs with movement logic and question handling that tested our patience and taught us the importance of thorough testing.

**Despite everything, we stayed positive, supported each other, and pulled through with a project we’re truly proud of!**
