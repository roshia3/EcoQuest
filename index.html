    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <p>In EcoQuest, your goal is to reach the end of the board. 
      Click "Start EcoQuest" to begin your journey. 
      Along the way, you'll land on spaces that challenge your environmental knowledge with a series of questions. 
      Answer correctly to earn points and move forward, but if you answer incorrectly, you'll move back a space.
      Beware of the spaces marked 'x', you'll move back anywhere from one to three spaces.
      Have fun, and make the best choices to build a Greener World!</p>
